MEASURING THE INTENSITY OF SOCIAL VULNERABILITY 

In the context of escalating environmental hazards, such as the 2021 floods in Limburg, Netherlands,
 the urgent need for building resilient communities capable of withstanding natural disasters is increas
ingly apparent. This need aligns with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, specifi
cally the objectives of reducing inequalities (SDG10) and creating safe, resilient, and sustainable cities
 (SDG11). At the core of these goals lies the concept of social vulnerability, the susceptibility of different
 societal groups to harm due to environmental and social changes. Traditional methods for assessing
 social vulnerability, like the Social Vulnerability Index (SoVI) by Susan Cutter, provide a numeric assess

 their complex, interlinked nature. This thesis focuses on The Hague, Netherlands, and introduces an
 innovative, data-driven method to quantify the intensity of social vulnerabilities, combining SoVI with
 the Multidimensional Inequality Framework (MIF). Using quantitative analysis tools, such as Principal
 Component Analysis (PCA) and clustering algorithms, the research aims to dissect and quantify the
 different dimensions of social vulnerability at the neighborhood level, encompassing health, education,
 financial security, and societal participation. While this study is specifically situated within the urban
 context of The Hague, known for its data-driven policymaking approach, its findings have significant
 implications for enhancing the quality and efficacy of policy decisions in urban planning and disaster
 management. Theapproach undertaken in this thesis aligns with the objectives of the Engineering and
 Policy Analysis (EPA) Program at TU Delft and is particularly aimed at advising more informed poli
cymaking. By offering a more nuanced understanding of social vulnerabilities, this research seeks to
 inform policies that are better tailored to the needs of the most vulnerable populations, thus contributing
 meaningfully to the broader goals of social equity and urban resilience worldwide
